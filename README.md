## 📖 What is DBT Mitra?

**DBT Mitra** is a civic-tech web portal built to bridge the information gap between Maharashtra's students and the **MahaDBT (Maharashtra Direct Benefit Transfer)** scholarship ecosystem.

Every year, thousands of students miss out on scholarships they are entitled to — not because they don't qualify, but because the process feels overwhelming. DBT Mitra changes that by presenting scholarship information in a clear, accessible, and guided format.

> **Mission:** Make every eligible student in Maharashtra aware of the financial support available to them, and confident in their ability to apply.
